# BLASER: A Text-Free Speech-to-Speech Translation Evaluation Metric

BLASER leverages a multilingual multimodal encoder to directly encode the speech segments for source input, translation output and reference into a shared embedding space and computes a score of the translation quality that can be used as a proxy to human evaluation.

In this folder you can find tools to use BLASER to score speech translation and to train the BLASER supervised model.

BLASER relies on [SpeechLASER embeddings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/ust/examples/speech_matrix/speech_laser_encoders.md), follow the instructions there to download the embeddings and embed your speech segments.

## Files

- `model.py` contains the BLASER supervised model definition.
- `train.py` contains a script that you can use to train the BLASER model.
- `score.py` contains a script that you can use to score speech segments translations.

The train and score scripts are configured using [hydra](https://hydra.cc/), you can look at the base configurations in `blaser/conf/score.yaml` and `blaser/conf/train.yaml`, you will have to specify the `???` fields, either in your own configs, or over the CLI. Both scripts take pre-embedded files.

## Install
